0,"Amazon Basics Earbuds arrived in an excellent and typical Amazon Basics Box and it contained the Matte Charging Case along with the EarBuds which is partly Matte and partly Glossy along with a USB Type C cable and few spare ear tips. The build quality is amazing as usual and feels sturdy even though I'm not a huge fan of matte designed products.The most important thing to note is this Earbuds are so big and bulky which might not fit into someone who are having small or medium ears I suppose. Although it was light weight, I felt little uncomfortable while the pTron Earbuds were of a perfect fit to my ears which was neither bulky nor long and bigger when compared this one. But having changed the ear tips to smaller one provided it felt better but it was still uncomfortable due to its bulky size.Features: There is a lot of touch controls available to for increasing and decreasing the volume, playing the next track, pause and play etc. But it doesn't work flawlessly. It was always a hit and miss kind in my Samsung Smartphone which was little annoying at the beginning. But as I was using it more often, it felt ok eventhough there was a little delay in response which we will get used to while using it on a daily basis.I liked the sound effect they used to indicate the Earbuds establishing the Bluetooth connectivity and also when it gets disconnected. It was so pleasant for me. I never liked the usual connected and disconnected voice messages. This is one feature I really like in this Amazon Basics Earbuds.Performance: The most disappointing thing about this Earbuds is it's performance. First I tried using it to listen to the Podcast which gave me a pleasant experience in terms of sound quality and I was happy. But each time I try to pause a podcast episode by using long press it played the next episode instead of pausing. So it was a turn off for listening to Podcasts. But the touch controls were working perfectly when I connected it to my secondary Tecno Spark phone and pause and play was working perfectly. Wonder why it wasnt the same when conected to my Samsung Smartphone.Now I tried to use this Earbuds for listening to songs. There was a wierd buzzing noise constantly occuring which is total turn off while listening to music. But when I tried using it for longer, this particular buzzing noise was noticed only in a very few songs in my playlist while other songs played as usual. Unfortunately both my favourite songs that I played at first had that buzzing noise while using this earbuds. Though the same songs play perfectly in other bluetooth earbuds. But in general sound quality is good and clear.And finally the only one good aspect about this Earbuds is the actual ease of using it was while on a call. The sound quality was clear and the receiver was able to hear me properly so there is no problem with the mic too.And as same as the pTron Earbuds in my earlier review in Amazon, this one also looses connectivity just moving a couple of steps away from the phone which is another disappointment. So far Boat Bluetooth Headset has been the best when comes to staying connected for a fair distance. But considering most Bluetooth earbuds facing the same issue except a very few, its manageable for most people.Battery performance is good but cant say about the charging time as the device is yet to run out of charge. First impression of battery is good. It came with almost full charge out of the box and after a custom full charge before using, I have not yet required to charge the device. For every 1 and a half hours of playback the battery gets reduced by 20% which is quite good and promising.Pros:1. Good voice clarity and mic performance during a call.2. Connectivity Sounds.3. Competitive Pricing.4. Build Quality.5. Volume Increase and Decrease Touch Controls.Cons:1. Buzzing Noise while listening to music but only in few songs for reasons unknown.2. Frequent disconnections due to poor Bluetooth range.3. Bulky and Big.Conclusion: This Earbuds looks so promising with good build quality at a competitive price of Rs. 699 but there are a few performance issues which is not expected from an Amazon Basics Product.I'm not sure if I had received a defective product but after the initial impression this pair of earbuds performed much better overall when used frequently. Thought of getting a replacement but it seems like a common defect for all so even if I go for replacement it will be having the same issue I guess. So decided to use this as a backup for calls and some music as and when needed as a backup having got at Rs. 699 with so many offers and cashback bringing the price further down to reasonably a very affordable one. Overall a very valuable purchase I must say. Anyways at this price point its a good deal inspite of some imperfections when comes to performance.Note: Rated 4 Stars from earlier 2 Stars and updated the review after using it for an extended time period for the Build Quality and some innovations tried by Amazon Basics at a good affordable price. Performance and touch controls seemed to work much better after using it frequently."
1,"Zero Bass. If u r a bass lover then just skip this no need to buy. Only calm music can be heard on it clearly. Vocals in background r not clear and the crackling sound is too much annoying. Even if there is a very low bass in the music then this earbuds start crackling.. I m so annoyed that i felt if my eardrum has burst due to crackles. Built quality is good, look is good, sound is high. No bass, crackles for small bass also, bluetooth connect is very slow. No response if box is opened. Late finding of devices. I have already returned this product instead gone for truke brand."
2,Using it from one week and feels it's an average Product as it get disconnected and using while call audio will not go to another person. Mic has poor performance and Bluetooth has weak connection. Only plus point is it has strong battery life.
3,"Headphones are good. However Audio quality is average. good for Mobile calls, average for music. Battery life is not as mentioned. Headphones power discharge within 3-4 hours. Headphone case battery is good and lasts longer. Overall good headphones at low price."
4,"Well for the price is got it , it is quite an balanced product with somewhat decent build quality and decent sound experience.. Although it doesn't support AAC but SBC is also good and Battery Life is quite good compared to others like Ptron...but the earbuds are bulky and too big to fit in my ear tho it may vary from person to person..After using a period of time my ears starts paining cause these don't fit properly in my ears cause of its large size.."
5,"Decent quality, sound, bass , bluetooth, looks"
6,Some time Bluetooth connectivity. Automatic lose.
7,"This doesn't justify the Amazon basic quality product.Build is definitely great and need to be appreciated but everything stops there, the connection, pairing and lighting mechanisms are pathetic.One pair connects with another with a weird sound and unpleasing lighting.Sound profile is mostly bass-oriented and doesn't do justice to day-to day listening of music and videos.4 Battery indicators lights on the box are buggy; they don't switch off sometimes even after a minute or so.Wish I had put some more money and purchased a good quality product. Above all, the no return policy is the most annoying. Need to be really careful while ordering anything online, if a product is of poor quality customer should have all the rights to return and get the refund for it."
8,"Overall product is good, sound quality is like premium earbuds and a decent amount of noise cancelation. Microphone quality is also good but the problem is that the battery backup of the bud is around 2hr approx on 70 percent of volume."
9,Need to upgrade the product not as I compared with others Bluetooth connectivity issue issue get disconnected automatically on sound during the call must work on the Bluetooth connectivity issue which rest design and casing is good enough but the only issue with connectivity

12,Lighter than any other bluetooth
13,"Its perfect for me. Am happy except that sometimes the connection breaks intermittently and rest of the time works flawlessly.Also, this is a personal thing - the buds are a bit large for my ears / but that depends on individual to individual - but just an info,"

24,"I bought this on Oct 18 for Rs 699/- thinking that this would work for at least 6 months.The earphones worked for 2 days and It‚Äôs not recognisable by any leave in the 2nd week. ( Tried with different phones/ iPad / laptop)The most irritating part is after sales. It took about 3 weeks for them to pick the product and process a refund.I was going round in circles for 2 weeks and when XOR technologies ( Manufacturer) didn‚Äôt respond to emails and calls, I had to send screenshots of emails, invoice and product images to get be able to get a return pickup."

26,value for money
27,"writing this review after almost 24 hrs of use.Got this at launch for 699 Im guessing after initial phase amazon will increase price.However I would be happy to pay even 1200 for this.My Cons so far :1. Packing is seriously substandard. Its packed in a similar box a mouse is packed. A basic corrugated paper box with earbud sticker on it. Though this has nothing to do with performance of earbud but packing is first part of first impressions of a product.2. 4 Lights on case - I personally didnt like it but i understand thats being most economical way to indicate battery status, still........3. Earbud Design - Looks like from 1st generation of earbud.Pros :1. Sound: Clear sound. For me personally, music at 75% Volume was sufficient. What earbud lacks in design it surely covers up in sound. At 100% full volume you could feel earbud is at its limit & will crack up after 6 months - 1 year of use.2. Ease of Use - Single tap volume controls, double tap song change, 2 second hold play pause/reject calls, tripple tap voice assistant, hold 5 seconds power on-off. Its easy to use without accessing your phone.3. Material : Not premium but definitely neither cheap too. Plastic feels good.Since i got this at 699 I can live with those cons & give 5 star rating. At 1200 price its 4 star product.My Take : Worth buying @ 1200 or less."
28,I bought them for 699 and these are one of the best wireless earphones ever at this price point. The sound is clear and loud enough. The battery stays for long as mentioned 38 hours. The build quality is very nice and feels comfortable.
29,Product was good but it was used product nd return item was used
30,"Over all ok, but too much costIt don't deserve this price, price have to be decreased"
31,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Good at that price"
32,
33,Ok
34,Nice
35,Brilliant pair of earbuds
36,It's good.
37,"1. There are stupid noises when the buds pair with each other. They sometimes pair with eachother if you have stopped playing music.2. Noise cancellation mentioned in the description is not active, the image is misleading.3. Charging light on the case remains on till the buds have charged to 100% ! Who thought of this idea ü§£ Such a waste of energy & super annoying.4. The ear buds themselves also have lights to indicate pairing, makes it look trashy.5. Audio & mic is decent in a quiet environment.Please get rid of all these lights, it ain't a Xmas tree! Let me know if I can return it."
38,Good battery backup and noise cancellation worth for money..
39,The device doesn't automatically connect to the Bluetooth of your phone. Everytime I have to pair manually and it's not an ideal feature. And the grip is also not that good. I'd recommend to go for Ptron bassbuds lite which is a little big in size but works better than this.
40,"I purchased this just to get a feel of Wireless earbuds and I'm not happy with my choice.1- This does not fit my ear, but fits my wife's ears - So, not for everyone2- Soundquality is very poor, similar to that 100Rs headphones from Busstand and Railway Stations3- Noice Cancellation - Similar to my wired Boat headphone, nothing more than that4- Battery - Good battery backupBuy this just for the same of having a true wireless buds, not for any other reason."
41,This earbuds is looking good and sounds quality is also best bass was super and feel 3d sound fitting was also great easily paired and battery performance is good i like this product more and you can also buy and feel real music sound
42,"For me these are average and somewhat uncomfortable.1.Fell off more often2.Hurts your ears after using for much time.3.The aound quality is not that good, if you increase the volume you even the best quality audio becomes cringe.4.Battery life is excellent .5.Its good for indoor calling/quiet places."
43,Bluetooth Connectivity is very Low Don't Buy this Product  if you've. 700 rs  for this item You Can Add 300rs more rs and buy other buds better then this ..
44,They have very best build quality of case and buds then any other products. It can also charge faster then any other buds and have very long battery life and it also have very good bass and treble
45,"they  have a more neutral default sound profile, which some users may prefer, and their mic has a better recording quality. They also have a low-latency mode '"
46,This earbuds is looking nice and good quality sound bass is was very amazing easily pairs and long life battery backup i suggest to buy this nice earbuds such a osume product i have see thank you amazon.
47,"They  have  better built quality, and they offer more comprehensive controls. That said, they also have better noise isolation thanks to their adjustable ANC feature."
48,The sound is very balanced in the product.Whether it is bass or treble or tunes everything is perfectly balanced. Amazing product and a must buy. Thanks Amazon.
49,Sound quality is good and battery backup is more than enough. Over all value for money. It's a good product. You can buy this.
50,"This Truly Wireless are  better then any other Truly Wireless. They are more comfortable, and they have a longer continuous battery life. Also, their microphone has a better recording quality."
51,"This are great for commute and travel. Thanks to their lightweight and portable design, you can easily store these comfortable and well-built earbuds in your pocket or bag on the go"
52,they have the same premium build quality as their other products. They also have balanced and very punchy audio . It's worth for its price
53,"While both buds are well-built and have similarly excellent levels of noise isolation thanks to their ANC systems, they have a better battery performance then any of others buds"
54,Bass is good sound quality is superb easily paired long life battery backup design is good I like this product more
55,This earbud has huge scope of improvement for Amazon Basics - Software need better bluetooth connectivity - Design of buds - weight of the earbud - Functionality & technologyMust say Amazon/vendor did not give its 100% to this product
56,A fantastic product by Amazon and I'm very happy to have this one
57,Good sound quality battery backup is also good bass is superb easily paired I love this product
58,"Sound quality is good, long backup andlow weight."

87,"Packing good.., sound quality ok...But it seems like there is some design flaw and particular beats found unbearably noisy.. Don't know whether it's defective product sent for me or everyone experiencing the same..Recently my friend purchased noise vs102. While comparing this amazon basics Bluetooth earbuds with noise vs102 earbud noise vs102 is a clear winner in every aspect...(sound quality, battery backup, beats,fit)..I am going to refund Amazon basics Bluetooth earbuds it's not upto the quality they mentioned in their ads....Replacement update:I have put replacement for this one and got new one delivered yesterday.The noise i mentioned above exists with the new one also so it seems like there is a design flaw..If you have this earphone and don't know what I'm talking just play vainko song in YouTube with this earphone you can hear a noise in between beats..that beat comes in different songs and in all the different songs you will experience an unbearable noiseDon't waste your money on a prototype product..I am definitely going to refund my earphone."
88,Connectivity issue. Creating nuisance sound on high beats. Very cheap product from Amazon.
89,Sound is often breaking on call or music when battery comes below 70%.
90,It fit my ears well. Sound is clear even though I could hear what others were talking in the room. I think battery life is good too. It was worth the money i paid for it.
91,Very uncomfortable in the ear.  And. Gets disconnected easily unexpectedly
92,
93,There are some stupid noises coming from earbuds. Amazon has cheated its customers to give a good earbuds and I believed in their products and finally concluded that Amazon is a big cheater.I  suggest you that this earbuds are suitable for use.I give a final advice is that don't buy this products in online like Amazon platform instead try buying outside at a popular places where earbuds are good and even u can try physically there.
94,Audio quality on call is so bad and connectivity is also not goodI have requested for replacement and not replacement done in app it's showing deleverd what happened with Amazon
95,Misc play wath not working
96,Good
97,"Only one side getting connected. Tried so many times. Don't know why but even it is full charged and there is no service seems to be available nearbyAlso, sensor of left earbud is continuous onLight of box is not getting off"
98,It doesn't work during high beat music and suddenly there is no sound at certain times
99,i like the product. Amazon TWS is a perfect tws in the market in this price. it's bass is clear & sound quality is good. Amazing battery backup
100,Value for money product
101,Overall disappointed
102,Weast of money please take boat or any brand

272,"Frequently skips audio playback, as it fails to maintain a steady connection, despite the PC or mobile being within arms reach. Audio quality is average. I tried returning the product upon delivery, but they said they can only do a replacement.I wanted to leave a feedback immediately to warn others, but the app didn't let me. The customer care executive gave me a generic email to forward the complaint, I didn't follow up. There were no reviews for this at that time, possibly for this reason. They simply wanted people to trust Amazon and buy it and make a lot of money during Prime Days.More than anything else, I hated not being able to post a feedback. I feel that they abused their position as gatekeepers."
273,I really had lots of hopes in this product. When it arrived it was working great worth the price. But later I discovered it has really small grip and doesn't fit well with any size of ear buds. There is no refund for the product only exchange. At least they could have exchanged a product with some other model. Never going to buy a Amazon basic product. You can compare the ‚Çπ150 ear phones grip with this ‚Çπ699 product.
