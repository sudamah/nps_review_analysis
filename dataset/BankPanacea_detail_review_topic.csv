Great experience beginning to end I had occurred some credit card debt while in residency and wanted to consolidate the debt into one loan I got multiple pre approvals from other banks but none of the was even close when it came to interest rate Panacea offered me a loan with interest rate that was less than half of the lowest interest rate I got elsewhere with even longer term more time to payoff the loan and thus lower monthly payment and they didn t even do a hard pull on my credit it was just a soft inquiry and thus doesn t not affect your credit score Add to that that the fact that the minimum required monthly payment is about a month while in training and no penalties to pay off earlier This was a great experience all together I recommend this to any other physician in training I would also like to give a special shout out to Alex Kugler the personal banker that was assigned to my account He was very responsive and would reply to emails within minutes not matter what time I emailed him and he walked me through the whole process ,"great experience,multiple pre,lowest interest,longer term,monthly payment,soft inquiry,monthly payment,great experience,special shout,alex kugler,personal banker,whole process",POSITIVE,information

Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with Panacea I am a medical doctor and full time faculty at UCSF for years with credit score above without even one late payment or any red flags on my credit history and still they rejected me for a loan First they told me my Equifax credit report shows that I am actively under credit counseling even though the report showing that the accounts were paid off and close Anyhow it was a small mistake by Equifax which was obvious But after they rejected me and I put star here Dr Palmer contacted me and told me if I correct it they will approve my loan After two months contacting to Bureau and banks I corrected the error and they again rejected me This time they said they cannot approve me because when I was resident in I paid my debt by a credit counseling company I didn t consolidate my debt meaning that I did not go through debt forgiveness and paid off all my debts without even one late payment during my residency Back in when I was struggling as a resident I had no choice but to pay off my debts mainly due to paying expensive books and academic activities gradually and Chase bank and Experian credit company representatives told me it s the best way to pay without any bad effect on my future credit and the only set back was that I couldn t get any loan untill I pay off my entire debts which I did even years sooner in After that I was able to get home mortgages and multiple personal loans and car loans ovell over million dollars Not even once anyone told me that is a bad effect and not even once I was rejected for a loan because of my history of paying my debts fully with a company But now that I saw the advertisement about Panacea saying they are here to help doctors and they understand what difficult way we endure during our decades of study I decided to try if I can get a loan so I can invest I actually didn t need it But it really hurt me that this company which is supposed to support doctors rejected my application for an illogical reason Just because I decided to pay my debt years ago via a company based on the bank and credit companies suggestion They told me I have to apply next year so it must be years after I paid my debt It s not a bankruptcy or debt resolution that put negative effect for years I should not have any problem getting a loan after finishing my debt via counseling When I compare Panacea with other companies and banks that I was able to get over million loans over the past years I cannot give them more than star They ejected me based on something that they didn t even put on their advertising that they have this kind of unrealistic criteria for loan otherwise I would have never applied ,"good experience,medical doctor,full time,late payment,red flag,small mistake,correct approve,late payment,expensive book,academic activity,experian credit,best way,bad effect,future credit,entire debt,personal loan,bad effect,advertisement panacea,difficult way,illogical reason",POSITIVE,information

I am a second year medical student and heard about Panacea while listening to the Short Coat podcast I decided to try it out and was quite skeptical since it isn t one of the large banks although it is a division of Primis Financial Corp Here s what I think after regularly using Panacea for a little over one month Pros No fees associated with EFT ACH transactions and free transfers with Zelle This is the main reason I opened an account since it allows me to send and receive funds between my trading accounts crypto and stock and bank account My large bank charges per transaction Note wire transfers still have a fee and the trading crypto platform you use may still have a fee Customer support Amazing customer support They always respond within hours even on the weekends and are always so helpful This is another one of the main reasons I switched since they were always quick to answer any of my questions I hope they continue this as they grow Free nationwide ATM use I was unfamiliar with this and got a little upset when I went to an ATM for the first time and was charged a fee from the ATM I was using I thought Panacea was using deceptive wording to make it seem like its free since they don t charge a fee and just left out that the ATM company will charge you Thankfully I was refunded the but it took nearly weeks to receive the refund Cons I have come across a few online purchases that would not accept the Panacea debit card Although rare it has occurred and if I switched to my large bank debit card the transaction would go through The website and mobile app UI is not the greatest Although simple to use for basic things like checking you transactions it is not as friendly or organized I feel when trying to do things like finding and quickly copying your account router Overall I love Panacea so far but I do not know if I am comfortable yet with fully switching I think in the future I may but for now it s a great accessory account and I will most likely utilize their loan consolidation once I am a th year ,"second year,medical student,short coat,large bank,free transfer,main reason,large bank,amazing customer,main reason,quick answer,nationwide atm,first time,deceptive wording,online purchase,large bank,mobile app,basic thing,overall love,great accessory",POSITIVE,information
