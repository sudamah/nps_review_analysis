Suggestion: Let me setup online banking immediately - just disallow withdrawals until the 9 days are complete -- would have allowed me to get everything in place and move money into the account much quicker.

www.dugood.org,Randy Orchid,5,US,God and Dugood to our Rescue,In mid September my wife and I were in a bottomless pit with our finances. We prayed about it and dugood came to our rescue. Brandy Solinas and Margaret Lyons helped us create a schedule to catch up with our mortgage. But it was Sandy Ferrell who truly saved us. She taught me how to use accounting with the GDugood website and showed me how to make and stay on budgets. She really helped us out of the financial quagmire by suggesting and then helping us secure an equity loan. Her help included persuading her managers that we were not as big a risk as we looked. She suggested that I write a history of how we got into the mess to start with and then presented it to her bosses.On Friday 10-25-2019 we will close on the loan. That and the new understanding of finances and budgeting will allow us to never get in a economic disaster again. I credit God and Dugood Credit Union for the ability to secure our finances for the rest of our lives. My grateful thanks to both.,"Date of experience: October 23, 2019"

www.dugood.org,Gayle,5,US,Dugood mademy day!!,"I was in an automobile accident where a driver ran a red light and totaled my car. My car, that was financed by DuGood,  was almost paid off and I had been looking forward to  not having car notes for a while. The insurance company responsible for paying my expenses gave me two days before I had to turn in my rental car. And this was told to me the day before the 4th of July.  Of course I went to DuGood and told Kelly Rayon my problems. Kelli Rayon listened to me. She issued me a Pre- approval Certificate to look for a new car. Car dealers were having 4th of July sales  the next day and found the car I wanted at a very good price. Kelly made the process so easy. DuGood employees are so friendly and helpful.So competent at their jobs. I am so thankful for their help because I was  very frustrated by how I was treated by the responsible persons insurance company. DuGood has a customer for life. Thank you for all your help.","Date of experience: July 16, 2019"

The ladies said that dugood bank is a second chance bank and  would help people with small loans to repair credit. . So i waited at least a month, then  went in Monday Dec 3 to give dugood  a try. I brought my 3 year old with me because she had just had surgery and was still wearing  a neckbrace.  A lady walked me into her office,  she never introduced herself. Then in the middle of opening my account walks in another lady. She never introduced herself either. They both were just looking at me and my child funny.  Both were in the computer trying to figure out how to complete the questions i guess, because no one was saying anything. They were not very friendly. Finally they finished. I had a check i wanted to deposite. Low and behold they wouldn't  cash it. It would take 6 business days to appear in my account. They should have said that upfront.  I need to pay my rent by the 5th. I cant wait 6 days. Then i applied for a small loan at this ""second chance bank"" and low and behold i didn't get approved. This is not what i expected.  And the service was horrible.  Workers need to talk more and be friendly. No one in that location was nice. Its like the workers were mad at each other.

Although at the time the credit union was not able to refinance my car because of my credit, the loan officer in Orange was very sensitive to my situation. She encouraged me to come back in a year, continue to make my payments and to stay at my job. I followed her advice and a year later she was able to get my car refinanced to a lower payment. This was a game changer for me financially. Although I don't remember her name, I have never forgotten what she did for me. Because of her extra efforts, I am now self sufficient, out on my own and my credit score continues to improve. I've never gotten service so personal at another financial institution.

It was a Friday afternoon at 5:00 and the loan advisor said she would fax the dealership everything they needed in order for me to take possession of the new truck and would complete the rest of the paperwork on Monday when she returned. She even mailed me the forms that I needed to sign along with a stamped envelope to return them. Not only that, but the dealership couldn't match DuGood's interest rate.
