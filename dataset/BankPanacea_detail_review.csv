Providing my banking information was secure and funds were deposited into my account within a week of applying.

I had occurred some credit card debt while in residency and wanted to consolidate the debt into one loan. I got multiple pre-approvals from other banks but none of the was even close when it came to interest rate. Panacea offered me a loan with interest rate that was less than half of the lowest interest rate I got elsewhere with even longer term (more time to payoff the loan and thus lower monthly payment), and they didn??t even do a hard pull on my credit, it was just a soft inquiry and thus doesn??t not affect your credit score. Add to that that the fact that the minimum required monthly payment is about $100 a month while in training and no penalties to pay off earlier. This was a great experience all together. I recommend this to any other physician in training. I would also like to give a special shout out to Alex Kugler, the personal banker that was assigned to my account.

panaceafinancial.com,Amir Qorbani,1,US,False advertising! Definitely not here to "help" doctors!,"Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with Panacea! I am a medical doctor and full time faculty at UCSF for 3 years with credit score above 760 without even one late payment or any red flags on my credit history, and still they rejected me for a loan! First they told me my Equifax credit report shows that I am actively under credit counseling even though the report showing that the accounts were paid off and close! Anyhow it was a small mistake by Equifax which was obvious! But, after they rejected me and I put 1 star here, Dr. Palmer contacted me and told me if I correct it they will approve my loan! After two months contacting to Bureau and banks I corrected the error and they again rejected me! This time they said they cannot approve me because when I was resident in 2017 I paid my debt by a credit counseling company. I didn't consolidate my debt, meaning that I did not go through debt forgiveness and paid off all my debts without even one late payment during my residency! Back in 2017 when I was struggling as a resident I had no choice but to pay off my debts (mainly due to paying expensive books and academic activities) gradually and Chase bank and Experian credit company representatives told me it's the best way to pay without any bad effect on my future credit and the only set back was that I  couldn't get any loan untill I pay off my entire debts, which I did even 3 years sooner in 2019!! After that I was able to get 3 home mortgages and multiple personal loans and car loans (ovell over 2.5 million dollars). Not even once anyone told me that is a bad effect and not even once I was rejected for a loan because of my history of paying my debts fully with a company! But now that I saw the advertisement about Panacea saying they are here to ""help"" doctors and they understand what difficult way we endure during our decades of study, I decided to try if I can get a loan so I can invest! I actually didn't need it! But it really hurt me that this company which is supposed to support doctors rejected my application for an illogical reason! Just because I decided to pay my debt 5 years ago via a company based on the bank and credit companies suggestion!!! They told me I have to apply next year so it must be 6 years after I paid my debt! It's not a bankruptcy or debt resolution that put negative effect for years! I should not have any problem getting a loan after finishing my debt via counseling! When I compare Panacea with other companies and banks that I was able to get over 2.5 million loans over the past 5 years I cannot give them more than 1 star! They ejected me based on something that they didn't even put on their advertising that they have this kind of unrealistic criteria for loan, otherwise I would have never applied!","Date of experience: November 17, 2022"

panaceafinancial.com,Melissa K.,5,US,Excellent Loan for Medical Students,"Working with Panacea Financial has been a delight, and the process of applying for a Medical Student PRN Loan was simple and quick. I love that the underwriting is written clearly on the website, so that there are no surprises after applying for the loan. There is no compounding interest, and the repayment plan is reasonable. There are also no penalty fees for repaying back the loan early. The interest rate is fair, especially for medical students who might not have been able to apply for a residency relocation loan at other banks without a cosigner. Panacea Financial has given me the financial security to relocate to my residency, while also redistributing the money I have on my high interest credit cards to an account with a lower interest rate. It is rare to find any company that understands the position of medical students and their ability to fund their transition to residency.","Date of experience: March 31, 2022"

panaceafinancial.com,Kirby S.,5,US,Review after a little over one month of regular use,"I am a second year medical student and heard about Panacea while listening to the Short Coat podcast. I decided to try it out and was quite skeptical since it isn't one of the ""large banks,"" although it is a division of Primis Financial Corp. Here's what I think after regularly using Panacea for a little over one month.Pros:1. No fees associated with EFT (ACH transactions) and free transfers with Zelle: This is the main reason I opened an account since it allows me to send and receive funds between my trading accounts (crypto and stock) and bank account. My large bank charges $15 per transaction. Note: wire transfers still have a fee and the trading/crypto platform you use may still have a fee.2. Customer support: Amazing customer support! They always respond within 12 hours (even on the weekends) and are always so helpful. This is another one of the main reasons I switched, since they were always quick to answer any of my questions. I hope they continue this as they grow!3. Free nationwide ATM use: I was unfamiliar with this and got a little upset when I went to an ATM for the first time and was charged a $3.50 fee from the ATM I was using. I thought Panacea was using deceptive wording to make it seem like its free since they don't charge a fee and just left out that the ATM company will charge you. Thankfully, I was refunded the $3.50, but it took nearly 3 weeks to receive the refund.Cons:1. I have come across a few online purchases that would not accept the Panacea debit card: Although rare, it has occurred and if I switched to my large bank debit card the transaction would go through.2. The website and mobile app UI is not the greatest: Although simple to use for basic things like checking you transactions, it is not as friendly or organized (I feel) when trying to do things like finding and quickly copying your account/router #Overall, I love Panacea so far but I do not know if I am comfortable yet with fully switching. I think in the future I may but for now it's a great accessory account and I will most likely utilize their loan consolidation once I am a 4th year.","Date of experience: September 21, 2021"

Within a half-hour after I submitted the application I had a personal banker send me an email about the application (not a copy-paste pre-made email). On the same afternoon I had the money already deposited in my account. And interspersed throughout that small window of time I had several emails (again, personal emails) updating me on every stop of the process). Signing the note was all electronic. Interest rate was significantly lower than the two loans I consolidated with the money. The icing on the cake is that I'm paying interest-only until I finish residency, with no prepayment penalty so I can throw more at it during residency if I want, and then pay it off once I graduate. I've never been given so much financial breathing room with so little effort.","Date of experience: September 03, 2021"

When in came to searching for loan at this time, I had the idea to google ??physician loan? because I had heard in past about certain companies that help physicians with home loans.   I needed a loan for that in between time of residency and attending while waiting for credentialing as well as some help re-strategizing my credit card to get my finances in healthier shape and on right track. I was attracted to Panacea because they looked at the whole picture and would would understand a physician debt:income ratio.

panaceafinancial.com,Kyle,5,US,Best financial institution I have worked with,"I initially became involved with Panacea only for that PRN loan - I appreciated their mission of offering simple products to doctors, with the understanding that debt burden and financial considerations on paper do not often reflect how low-risk physicians are as borrowers. For my purposes (debt consolidation), no other lender offered a product that was at all comparable to what Panacea was offering.I was so impressed with how straightforward and easy the application process was, that I went ahead and set up a checking and savings account as well.

panaceafinancial.com,Paige Hall,5,US,This company is brilliant!,"This company is brilliant. The fact that they consider future earnings potential as opposed to just the standard credit factors is a godsend. My husband started an application on a Monday, and was able to sign loan documents early that afternoon. He was informed that the funds will be disbursed and will hit our account within the next 3-5 business days (and, from what I gather,  it could be as little as 24 hours if being disbursed to a Panacea Financial bank account). The concierge service and the personal banker my husband interacted with were professional, friendly, and cognizant of a busy 2nd year resident's schedule. I was also able to call the concierge service and ask questions about the documentation requirements and received the same courteous service. I could not recommend this financial institution enough.UPDATE: At the last minute (like probably 3 or 4:30 pm EST), I asked my husband to check with our personal banker to see if we could open a Panacea Checking account and have the loan proceeds disbursed to the new account. Knowing it was probably a long shot, I anxiously waited for my husband's reply. Within minutes, our personal banker had responded with instructions on how to open the checking account, stating that he would have underwriting send revised contracts showing the funds to be disbursed to our brand new checking account. My husband received the revised contracts around 9:30 am CST, signed them, and within an hour  (maybe two),  our account was funded. I thought that it was not possible for this financial institution to impress me more, yet they have (and I would guess they will continue to) with each and every interaction.","Date of experience: January 12, 2021"

Panacea felt like a godsend because they took our unique financial circumstances and future income potential into account. Their rate was much better than other lenders, including those other lenders who cater to medical professionals. We were somewhat skeptical with the whole process being online and the company being relatively new, but after talking to a banker on the phone I felt comfortable and decided to proceed. I am so glad I did. The whole process was straightforward, streamlined, and even pleasant.

Within an hour of applying, I was approved and I received an email (from a real person no less) welcoming me and making sure all of my questions were answered and my needs were being met. All of this happened without leaving my couch. The actual accounts are perhaps more impressive, though. No ATM fees anywhere, free checking, and 24 hour a day customer service.
