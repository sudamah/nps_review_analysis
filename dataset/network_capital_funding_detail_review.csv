I got a great recommendation from Abel Gilbert of One Path Realty, a person who I trust and who has been a great friend of mine since high school. He spoke to me about Gabriel Flores and said in his opinion he is the best out there for lots of reasons which of course I experienced later on. From the beginning Gabriel made me feel comfortable and confident that he would do everything he can to reach our goal. He seemed to care as much as I did to try and get a good loan, and that's what made him special. A very genuine person and one who was available every time I had a question. One of his great attributes is making sure you understand 100% of the process, in which sometimes can be a bit confusing since there's so many steps and rules. Also I was amazed at the pace he works, making sure that everything gets turned in on time and also reminding me of all the things I have to do on my side. Overall my experience with Gabriel was amazing, I would and WILL recommend him to anyone who needs a loan and will tell them the truth of how smooth, easy and great it was my experience with Gabriel. After a few weeks I also had the pleasure to work with Lou Ellen StaAna who was great as well. She was very sweet, courteous and also cared a lot about my situation. I consider my self very lucky to have been able to be helped by two AMAZING people who made my experience so easy and beautiful. Thank you!","Date of experience: August 29, 2022"

networkcapital.net,customer,5,US,We've used Network Capital several…,"We've used Network Capital several times for refinancing with great results. This was the first time using them for a new sale mortgage. I wasn't sure whether they could handle the dc area housing competition surge in the spring of 2022 and the need for quick turn arounds. But they did, thank God. First, Paul M. was such a reliable, supportive, and responsive help during the search. Paul's accurate and highly professional style was priceless. Paul was also extremely patient and very likeable.  Ian J. was extremely wonderful helping me through all of the business, loan, and rate terms, as his knowledge and experience is top notch. Joseph Francia was awesome as my processor. Joseph left nothing undone and there were no surprises. He was polite and reassuring. Helen L. leads with excellent customer service at the forefront and this is precicely what causes me to return. I feel like my business is appreciated and that if there's an issue it will be resolved, not ignored. Helen cares.  Diane W, is quite thoughtful and was very helpful intervening when Nayeli, a processing manager, rudely told me during one of my most stressful moments to feel free to take my business elsewhere. She was incredibly argumentative, disrespectful and just awful to deal with. This was at a critical time when I was already in contract and at the home appraisal stage! So I would've had to start over with one of my other lenders until Diane reassigned me to someone else. So sorry for being late in doing this well-deserved review from spring 2022, but it is the least I can do to thank these awesome mentioned people who went above and beyond to support me and deliver during one of the most stressful periods and transactions in my life. Thank you and God bless.","Date of experience: May 01, 2022"

networkcapital.net,Jason Arefi,5,US,To whom it may Concern,"To whom it may ConcernThis is Jason Arefi. I had done five loans with network Capital before I did this recent one with Edwin. Before I met Edwin and Daniels, I had the terrible expense with customer service with Angelo's office and Angelo himself, which cost me two appraisals that I had to pay for the loans they approached me to do for a better rate. Both got declined after I paid over $1500 for an appraisal because of my Debt ratio they said was 55%, which wasn't making sense to me because I was approved with two other lenders for the other properties, which Network Capital declined, so I had to create a new purchase through a different lender. Until Edwine called me and said he could do the loan for me, my answer was to him no more Network Capital. No one knew what they were doing, and it always cost me money for an appraisal, which some salesperson promised was loan is going to work, and it doesn't. Angelo never calls back after multiply voice mail. Edwin told me to give him one chance, and I don't have to approve the appraisal until he makes sure the loan goes through. I still didn't want to do it, and Daniel told me something. They told me the Angelo office made a mistake on the calculation, and my debt ratio is only 31%, and both of them call me every day and inform me what is going on. You never can get hold of anyone in Angelo's office. Whoever runs this other office is doing an excellent job, and Edwin and Danel got me back to Network Capital. I never want to do business with Angelo's office ever again, and I want to thank Edwin and Daniel for Their professionalism; and I am making a new purchase that I will use again. They were the Best and made sure I didn't leave network capital. I think Angelo's office should pay for my appraisal.","Date of experience: May 18, 2022"

They did neither. Questions were promptly answered and thoroughly explained, with timelines and next steps kept. They also accepted my old survey while another who actually held my mortgage was requesting another survey. (This saved at least 1,600 out of my pocket.) Part of my income is typically not used for mortgage approval which reduced my income for approval. While other companies stated my options were limited due to reduced income, National Capital initially stated no problem and the initial quote provided was accurate.  Working with Network Capital was not only a predictable easy process, they patiently explained each step clearly and were personable as well. I actually enjoyed working with them.

networkcapital.net,anonymous,3,US,painful experience,"After a review of my existing mortgage, salesman #1 said that I could save almost $1000 per month by refinancing with Network Capital. He also promised a 1% discount on closing fees. Seemed like a no-brainer so I completed an application and submitted all of my financial documents, tax returns, etc. Shortly thereafter I was told that salesman #1 would no longer be handling my refi and my file was transferred to salesman #2. Eventually I received a loan proposal but the numbers didn't seem quite right and the 1% discount on closing fees, which was promised by salesman #1, had not been applied. When I mentioned this to #2, he was not aware of the 1% discount. I asked him to review the file, make the necessary corrections, and re-submit a new proposal to me. I never heard from salesman #2 again but now salesman #3 was on the case. A few weeks later, I was told that we were ready to close and I told #3 that I still did not have an amended loan proposal. Finally, on the Friday night of the weekend before the Monday that we were going to close I received a new loan proposal and it looked nothing like the proposal that was submitted to me originally, even with the mistakes that it had. This new proposal had a monthly mortgage payment that was almost exactly what my existing mortgage payment was. I angrily told #3 ""thanks but no thanks"". After almost a month's time and innumerable hours of working on this deal, we had no deal. Long story short, #3 went back, sharpened his pencil, and came up with a new loan package which I agreed to but I am only saving about two or three hundred dollars per month. As a post-script to this story, today I received a call from an auditor at Network Capital saying that they need to see my 2019 and 2020 tax returns for an audit. I said "" you've got to be kidding me, we just closed this loan a few weeks ago and I submitted my tax returns at the very beginning of this process several months ago, it should be in my file."" Salesman #3 sent me an email saying ""sorry we don't have those tax documents that you submitted to salesman number #1, he is no longer with our firm."" I've been involved in real estate since the 1980s and have refinanced loans over a dozen times. This was easily the most frustrating refi I've ever been involved in. In all fairness to salesman #3, he seems like a very nice guy and he is very professional, but there are issues with this firm.","Date of experience: March 29, 2022"

networkcapital.net,customer,5,US,Process when smoothly most of the time summation,Process when smoothly most of the time.  Reasonable expenses and not alot of needless requests.  Major disappointment was the need for reappraisal on property that had a appraisal less than two months before.  The appraiser just walked through the house and most likely used that prior appraisal as I was kind enough to give him a copy of that appraisal.   So the $730 cost seemed excessive and insult to injury was not understanding why it was needed.  Yes a wslk through to see if it was still there and in good condition I understand but $730 for that service was excessive in my opinion.  Otherwise all other aspects of the process went smoothly.,"Date of experience: March 29, 2022"

networkcapital.net,customer,5,US,Very impressed with Anthony Baronci,"We worked with Anthony Baronci and closed last week. The refi could not have gone smoother which was in large part due to Anthony's knowledge, professionalism, and patience. Network Capital did everything they said they would do, they did it in a timely manner, and we didn't need to worry about anything. Our refi was small, and yet we were treated as if we were refinancing ten properties. The Closing Processor, Sang Truong, who is also awesome, was part of the transaction from the beginning which made things easier and more efficient. The entire process would have taken less than ten days to close except I was more busy than normal at work. Among the many instances where we could tell we were dealing with an honest company was that everything occurred in a single email thread. The entire email transaction history was preserved in every correspondence. Just scroll down; no need to go looking for a separate email from the week before to see what was agreed to. This may seem trivial but one of the things that bothers us is the common practice of creating new threads which bury original agreements or decisions. We've bought several houses in our lifetimes, and refinanced more than a few -- and can't say any of them were free of concerns. Every time there was a concern on our part, Anthony was on the spot to address it. I discovered at the end of the process that *none* of our concerns were actually worth worrying about; there just weren't any surprises or overlooked items. A final word about our loan officer - Anthony Baronci is a good person and a miracle worker who knows what he's doing, and Network Capital is providing an environment where someone like him can substantially help people like us.

networkcapital.net,Paul from southern Maryland,5,US,Over all wonderful experience,"Hello my name is Paul, I would like to start  off by saying I'm a happily married man to a wonderful woman and we have 8 children who we were blessed with.  We just moved about 3 years ago to a bigger house.  We had 2 vehicle  notes that we were paying on prior to our new house  and with the current pandemic I was in a tight spot financially.  We got into some credit card debt that we haven't had since our early 20's.  So we were paying everything on time but with the credit cards it was the bare minimum.   We were getting  nowhere fast.  We live on a great single family income  but we let things get a little out of hand.  On top of that we had my mother move in and with inflation affecting everything it was becoming worse financially.  So on my home for the past year I listen to talk radio and I trust the radio host and the show that I listen to.  They had network captiol funding come over the radio. I listened to it for weeks and on Saturdays they had a radio show about network Capitol Funding and I listened to the good things people were saying about their lives and how this company helped them out.  I went home and talked it over with my wife and we were both a little unsure but we prayed  on it.  So now we decided to give them  call and that's when I got to meet over the phone and talk to Jordan and Johnathan.  They were just awesome.  They both were not only truthful about everything I could ask them but they also ran some options over for us and they both were very knowledgeable about the line of work they do.  Not only were they helpful and very good at their jobs they asked me about my life and my family.  So I told them a little about our lives.  We have custody of 3 of the 8 kids.  They are my neices and nephew. My wife and I have 5 together.   They have been with us since birth and we really consider them as our daughters and son.  The youngest of the 3 just had his 3rd open heart surgery at 4 years old.. He has been in the hospital for over a month now and is doing great. We hope he will come home soon.   Now I did not talk to these guys at the same time.  They were on separate occasions and they both were very respectful as well as very professional but most importantly understanding and compassionate about our lives and what our son was going thru. So they both were  religious and they both asked what his name was so they could pray for his very serious surgery.   That was amazing to hear not only are they doing a great job helping us but also very concerned about our son and praying for him. Both Jordan and Johnathan always asked how he was doing on every phone call we had. As we are going through this refinance and home equity loan and our everyday lives both of these guys were just awesome and amazing with what they did for me and my family and just to know that their are people on the other side of the country helping us out but even more importantly praying for our son who was going thru this, it was just honesty amazing that God works wonders.  So my hat is off to you and your team members who made our lives so much more livable. They were able to reduce the overall loan by another 100000 and got us on a 20 year note they Paid off our 2 vehicles one at 15000 and the other at 10000.  That alone was 1500 a month.  They also got us 12000 cash back so we used that to pay off our credit card debt. And I am going to take this opportunity to get my credit back in check and in 6 months I will be calling network Capitol Funding back to refinance to a 15 year loan so they can save me another 100000 to 150000.  Jordan and Johnathan  I thank you guys for your prayers and your help to get me back on top of our finances again.  Thank you both and your team.  God bless yall and I'll be talking to you soon.","Date of experience: March 07, 2022"

I have two lenders competing and doing my two loans at the same time and I ended up with Network Capital due to the excellent customer service, constant communication, professionalism, integrity, personal touch, and always keeping me in the loop thru phone call follow ups from these two exemplary employees especially in this high-tech world where everything is streamlined via email. I wish all lenders have employees like Teddy and Sarah who did above and beyond their duty calls and performing their jobs even after office hours.If I have to rate their work and performance, I will give them the highest rate times 100. That’s how satisfied I am with the service I received from both of them.  If you want your lending needs taken care of, I highly recommend that you give Teddy a call and I can assure you that he’ll make sure he’ll take care of you.

His part of the mortgage and paperwork went smooth as silk, the easiest refi I have ever had up to that point. Then it went to your finance section, everything went downhill from there. Two of your employees got Covid totally understandable. The employees I did deal with including the supervisor did not even give me the courtesy of returning my calls. Every time I need to speak with Finance I had to contact Anthony Tomol. Who by the way answered my call every single time I called. When whoever it was contact me after those calls to Anthony they would always say I was just about to call you. The best example I could give you is, there was a misunderstanding on my part about what was needed from the insurance company. After finance found out the information that they needed they didn’t bother to call me back to tell me. Which left me struggling trying to make contact with the insurance company to try and find out information I didn’t even need. The misunderstanding was on my part but lack of return phone calls was on you. In summary I would say give Anthony Tomol a raise or a promotion And totally retrain finance on customer service skills. I will use your company in the future but I’ll keep my fingers crossed when my loan goes to finance. Thanks so much Rick and Gail Monroe","Date of experience: February 02, 2022"
