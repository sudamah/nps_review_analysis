The one is very excellent I have used many Bluetooth speakers JBL charge JBL flip Transit by Soans Harman Kardon etc pure balanced sound is what you get The problems I faced are The Bose Connect app is very poor The Bose Revolve ii does not support VOIP calls WhatsApp Zoom says Bose india Bose India customer service s response was inadequate The technical team apparently lack product knowledge ,"balanced sound,poor bose,technical team",appreciation,POSITIVE
I have been using it from months extensivelyIts a portable speaker so expect it to be like one My priority was great sound quality high portability this I m glad this is not chunky at all The sound quality is great gets too loud for indoor but for outdoor it s perfect for all the trips or camping Connectivity is fine but not impressive you will feel some lack of tech somewhere but it doesn t disappoints as well I would say it has what s required Battery backup is highly impressive but at full volume it isn t Although i hardly played it on full Goes full week on charge if you are listening it for hour daily Music quality is soothing I don t get tired of listening even for hours degree sound also plays its part well Look Brand value is top notch One of my fav feature is tripod mount it got Worth the money if you are getting it on discount as I did even discounted package was received in perfect condition If you are paying full price as on MRP then its an individual perception weather its worth or not ,"portable speaker,sound quality,high portability,sound quality,perfect trip,full volume,full week,daily music,worth money,perfect condition,full price,individual perception",information,POSITIVE
Review after a day of full usagea Bose seems to have missed the sweet spot of balanced sound II generation is heavy on Bass liked by most of the folks While it s equaliser from the source device can be adjusted to suit the need However for movies specifically for speech part sounds punchyb Still the best sounding speaker loud clear even at volume tested almost all genres including old songs Sounds superb everytimeC I ve connected Alexa Google home to play music via BT to play music wirelessly The phone gets free saves the batteryD Dual BT connectivity is great however you d expect BT version for speaker you buy in E It s a pity that they don t have adopted USB C charging yetF The Bose connect app is pretty basic doesn t have equilizer built in If played from TV or other sources it doesn t detect as music playing tends to auto switch off at timesOverall Verdict It s the Apple iPhone of speakers it isn t feature heavy but does the basic job superbly well consistently,"full usagea,sweet spot,ii generation,heavy bass,equaliser source,sound punchyb,old song,bt connectivity,bt version,basic equilizer,timesoverall verdict,basic job",information,NEGATIVE

I won t write much about the product because the ones who will go for BOSE already know what it s about It s worth it It is relative and debatable but to me it s worth But the shipment was awful Like most AMAZON deliveries it doesn t fail to disappoint To the buyers a product like this is a luxury not to be thrown around but to be cherished But you can see the condition the box came in There were no outer box Only the BOSE box with a thin plastic wrap damaged around the edges and on the corners mostly attributed to rough handling and absence of a outer cardboard package Very poor experience Photos attached for reference and heartiest thanks to amazon for ruining the beautiful box ,"much product,worth shipment,outer box,thin plastic,rough handling,outer cardboard,poor experience,beautiful box",information,NEGATIVE

I just received this little beauty I just connected vividh bharti FM from my Samsung s plus It stunned me with its brilliant and marvellous sound It has the cleanest and most transparent sound I know what is good sound I have kef q polk yamaha denon jbl sony panasonic all these audio systems But this little genius beats them all in sound clarity transparent and quality Yes bose do charge premium but bose knows how to reproduce sound from tiny speaker Do not talk of treble bass or vocal It has perfect It is foolish to compare other jbl or other bluetooth speakers It is sparkling gem Those like mine who never heard Bose must hear to believe what the Bose sound technology is Do not delay just go and buy as it is on discount Highest recommended ,"little beauty,vividh bharti,marvellous sound,transparent sound,good sound,little genius,sound clarity,transparent quality,tiny speaker,treble bass,foolish compare,bose sound",information,POSITIVE

Well satisfied The speaker the sound and the brand makes you feel Bossy Bose do make you feel Bossy The crispy vocals coupled with well balanced auto equalized bass gives you a very high satisfaction This is just what i wanted and if i have to buy again i may probably be buying another bigger speaker from this brand only If you are a very loud noisy cracking thundering and over the decibel music listener then you may opt for another option among other oversized portable speakers which you may probably have to carry over your shoulders from place to place ,"satisfied speaker,bossy bose,bossy crispy,balanced auto,equalized bass,high satisfaction,bigger speaker,portable speaker",appreciation,POSITIVE

Pretty good but somehow music audio is not as good as predecessor After having used both I d say the original revolve sounded more natural be it music movies or calls Had gone for Revolve II after the previous version died But couldn t find a better alternative than II Since start of this long lasting WFH I ve been using mostly for calls meetings Perfectly compatible with Windows and all the web bridges used including MS Teams which is the trickiest one just expect a few secs delay some times only when you receive a Teams call or join a meeting No lag otherwise Mic doesn t have noise cancellation but the other person can hear you perfectly well even if the speaker is feet away from you Plus it doesn t easily pick any background noise And needless to say speakerphone for phone calls is seamless Bluetooth connectivity is pretty quick as wellTo all seeing a different price tag it seems Bose mixed up in packaging The price tags on first lot were for Revolve the junior model which is actually for Correct price is However I raised this issue with Amazon and the team was kind to refund the balance,"good predecessor,original revolve,natural music,previous version,compatible window,mic noise,quick wellto,different price,mixed packaging,first lot,junior model,correct price",information,POSITIVE

It is slightly overpriced but I haven t heard another speaker that sounds as this one Advantages are that it s super portable with a case I bought separately it s moderately waterproof and durable Disadvantages because of its size it is not possible to fit in a bigger driver so it s the best you can get for its size if you want a speaker for an even bigger large open area often you should go for something as big as JBL boombox or partybox but then you will have to compromise on portabilityThis bose speaker is extremely portable and is the best audio for its sizeBase is not too Loud or low and has its own clarityOther frequencies are well balancedThough it is very versatile and can play all types of music it plays edm remixes the best as the sound designers make use of abilities of expensive speakers to play subtle notes ,"portable case,durable disadvantage,bigger driver,open area,audio sizebase,clarityother frequency,versatile play,best sound,expensive speaker,subtle note",information,POSITIVE

After investing so many days for the search of a good Speaker finally I choose Bose Soundlink revolve series As I am using it for the last days few things I would like to share Build In this price range may be it s not that much attractive but yes the build quality is really good and it s water splash resistance coating also alows you to take it outside from your room Sound The best part is at the high volume also the purity of sound remains same Bass Treble just exact where it should be Price For sound lovers price is not the matter when Bose arrived But ya they can reduce it s price by atleast k But I am ok with this price ,"many day,good speaker,soundlink revolve,last day,good water,outside room,best part,high volume,exact price,ok price",information,POSITIVE
I got this from Amazon earlier than expected Came in perfect condition But as someone else had also mentioned in the reviews the MRP on the box says Rs whereas I paid Rs for it I m satisfied with the product and love the sound but what s with the difference in pricing From my experience I usually pay lesser than the MRPs marked on the product box Amazon please explain this Aside from this the sound quality bass and power of this speaker is terrific Extremely happy with the sound You can also control the sound and bass based on where you place it in a room Corners tend to enhance the bass whereas the center of the room gives a more balanced sound ,"perfect condition,satisfied product,lesser mrps,sound quality,happy sound,balanced sound",information,POSITIVE

It s been over months my bose soundlink revolve bluetooth speaker is lying at bose service station Klickit solutions and services Mumbai for repair So either bose products are irreparable if so they should mention it while selling or they don t have proper service support in India if that s the case that should also be told while selling the product Either way I would never recommend bose products to anyone patheticservice avoidbose Your entire money will be zero once peoduct has any problem ,"soundlink revolve,bose product,irreparable mention,proper service,bose product,entire money",information,NEGATIVE
