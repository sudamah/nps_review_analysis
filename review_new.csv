0,the sous quality is world class but with the sterio the mono is only you can use for background for stereo order two and then feel the experienceas it is expensive too
1,"The one is very excellent, I have used many Bluetooth speakers, JBL charge, JBL  flip, Transit by Soans, Harman Kardon, etc. pure balanced sound is what you get.The problems I faced are:The Bose Connect app is very poor.The Bose Revolve+ ii does not support VOIP calls (WhatsApp, Zoom) says Bose india. Bose India customer service‚Äôs response was inadequate. The technical team, apparently, lack product knowledge."
2,quality sound with premium price
3,"I have been using it from 3 months, extensivelyIts a portable speaker so expect it to be like one. My priority was great sound quality & high portability & this I‚Äôm glad this is not chunky at all.The sound quality is great, gets too loud for indoor but for outdoor it‚Äôs perfect for all the trips or camping.Connectivity is fine but not impressive, you will feel some lack of tech somewhere but it doesn‚Äôt disappoints as well. I would say it has what‚Äôs required.Battery backup is highly impressive but at full volume it isn‚Äôt. Although i hardly played it on full. Goes full week on 1 charge if you are listening it for 1-2 hour daily.Music quality is soothing, I don‚Äôt  get tired of listening even for hours. 360 degree sound also plays its part well.Look & Brand value is top notch.One of my fav feature is tripod mount it got.Worth the money if you are getting it on discount as I did, even discounted package was received in perfect condition.If you are paying full price as on MRP then its an individual perception, weather its worth or not."
4,"Review after a  day of full usagea. Bose seems to have missed the sweet spot of balanced sound & II generation is heavy on Bass (liked by most of the folks). While it's equaliser from the source device can be adjusted to suit the need. However for movies, specifically for speech part sounds punchyb. Still the best sounding speaker, loud & clear even at 75% volume (tested almost all genres including old songs) Sounds superb everytimeC. I've connected Alexa & Google home to play music via BT to play music wirelessly. The phone gets free & saves the batteryD. Dual BT connectivity is great, however you'd expect BT version 5 for speaker you buy in 2022E. It's a pity that they don't have adopted USB C charging yetF. The Bose connect app is pretty basic, doesn't have equilizer built in. If played from TV or other sources it doesn't detect as music playing & tends to auto switch off at timesOverall Verdict - It's the Apple iPhone of speakers, it isn't feature heavy but does the basic job superbly well & consistently"
5,Na
6,"So the clarity is crisp you can hear the sound as if someone is singing next to you, recently when i played a movie there was a scene where a girl was screaming, my mother ran from kitchen just to see if anything had happened to my sister thats the sound quality it has."
7,Costly but the best blutooth speaker. You will fall in at first listen.
8,"I won't write much about the product because the ones who will go for BOSE, already know what it's about. It's worth it. It is relative and debatable but to me, it's worth 20,499/-But the shipment was awful. Like most AMAZON deliveries, it doesn't fail to disappoint. To the buyers, a product like this is a luxury, not to be thrown around but to be cherished. But you can see the condition the box came in. There were no outer box. Only the BOSE box with a thin plastic wrap, damaged around the edges and on the corners, mostly attributed to rough handling and absence of a outer cardboard package. Very poor experience. Photos attached for reference and heartiest thanks to amazon for ruining the beautiful box."
9,"Good product.Delivery was perfect. The box came in original factory plastic wrapping, brand new - May2022 manufactory and Aug2022 import date (Oct2022 i bought) Price on box - 29,400 which i got for 20,499 - real good deal."
10,"I just received this little beauty.  I just connected vividh bharti FM from my Samsung s20 plus.  It stunned me with its brilliant and marvellous sound.  It has the cleanest and most transparent sound.  I know what is good sound. I have kef q150 , polk, yamaha, denon  jbl  sony,panasonic all these audio systems.  But this little genius beats them all in sound clarity,transparent and quality.  Yes bose do charge premium but bose knows how to reproduce sound from tiny speaker. Do not talk of treble  bass or vocal.  It has perfect 10.  It is foolish to compare other jbl or other bluetooth speakers.  It is sparkling gem. Those like mine who never heard Bose ,must hear to believe what the Bose sound technology is. Do not delay...just go and buy as it is on discount! Highest recommended."
11,"Baniya people might say that product is overpriced but you will experience the sound quality only after listening to this assbomb. Afterall it's Bose , don't think twice if you are into music rather than a DJ guy . Buy Ahuja if you want loud election wala sound. This product is amazing and sound is natural, soothing and we'll balanced. Totally worth of money !!"
12,Absolutely worthy product‚Ä¶ Excellent quality of sound‚Ä¶Not tooo loud‚Ä¶.But exceptional quality of sound‚Ä¶Will recommend to anyone..üòÄüëåüèª
13,Sound quality to good but full sound box no clear bess
14,Very good clear sound
15,"Well satisfied.The speaker, the sound and the brand makes you feel Bossy. Bose do make you feel Bossy.The crispy vocals coupled with well balanced auto equalized bass gives you a very high satisfaction. This is just what i wanted and if i have to buy again i may  probably be buying another bigger speaker from this brand only.If you are a very loud, noisy, cracking, thundering and over the decibel music listener then you may opt for another option among other oversized portable speakers which you may probably have to carry over your shoulders from place to placeüòÜ"
16,People who love bass don't go for this. Go for JBL or Sony.With bass boosted songs bose doesn't do justice!Each syllable whether high or low is audible but the punch and feel of the bass is missing in this bose revolve+ Series 2.
17,Worth it
18,Sound quality is top notch. Built is just awesome. Very light weight. Easy to carry around and only con is it drains easily when i listen in 80-100 volume. Other than that it‚Äôs fantastic. Satisfied and love it. Thank you Bose.
19,The media could not be loaded.
20,The speaker‚Äôs adaptability quotient is great !! The sound never gets disturbing. In fact as it goes louder it gets even better. Smooth crisp sounds that adapt wonderfully to the room size.The packaging & delivery both were great !
21,
22,Best quality product . I used this product for riyaz in the morning and also while proforming on stage
23,Amazing perfect made to order for all moods
24,Must have for a personal use and small gatherings partyOverall good package.... who dont care much for trebble base etc functions... it is already optimized to songs u play
25,Liked it's superior sound quality. Superb and crystal clear.
26,"This is absolute of a beast speaker, don't go on its size. There is no song you won't like on this one."
27,"Pretty good, but somehow music/audio is not as good as predecessor. After having used both, I‚Äôd say the original revolve+ sounded more natural - be it music, movies or calls. Had gone for Revolve+ II after the previous version died. But couldn‚Äôt find a better alternative than II.Since start of this long lasting WFH I‚Äôve been using mostly for calls/meetings. Perfectly compatible with Windows 10 and all the web bridges used (including MS Teams, which is the trickiest one - just expect a few secs delay some times only when you receive a Teams call or join a meeting). No lag otherwise. Mic doesn‚Äôt have noise cancellation but the other person can hear you perfectly well even if the speaker is 3-4 feet away from you. Plus it doesn‚Äôt easily pick any background noise. And needless to say, speakerphone for phone calls is seamless. Bluetooth connectivity is pretty quick as wellTo all seeing a different price tag, it seems Bose mixed up in packaging. The price tags on first lot were for Revolve (the junior model which is actually for 19,900). Correct price is 24,500. However, I raised this issue with Amazon and the team was kind to refund the balance"
28,Natural sound and clarity
29,"Awesome sound quality, perfect blend of Base, treble, and overall music output. Perfect output even at high volume. Loving it..."
30,"With a perfect match of bass and treble and volume, it's a bang on . Amazingly superb quality."
31,Excellent in all forms
32,Bose is boss
33,buy it
34,Super
35,Good sound quality. Price is high.
36,"It is slightly overpriced but I haven't heard another speaker that sounds as this one.Advantages are that it's super portable with a case I bought separately, it's moderately waterproof * and durable .Disadvantages , because of its size it is not possible to fit in a bigger driver so it's the best you can get for its size , if you want a speaker for an even bigger large open area often you should go for something as big as JBL boombox or partybox but then you will have to compromise on portabilityThis bose speaker is extremely portable and is the best audio for its sizeBase is not too Loud or low and has its own clarityOther frequencies are well balancedThough it is very versatile and can play all types of music , it plays edm remixes the best , as the sound designers make use of abilities of expensive speakers to play subtle notes."
37,No bass

¬†This is my first Bose speaker. Arrived in two days after ordering. Price is as quoted ‚Çπ24500(please see pic above). Bluetooth connectivity is quick. The sound is loud enough but not that what compares to my 15000pmpo Sony system. But what amazes me is the sound clarity, notes, tones, bass etc. very distinct. Charged up to excess of 20 percent for some update through Bose app. Will update this review after more usage. So far so good. Made in Mexico. Manufacture November 2020.Update 1 : Good Battery Life (Haven't charged even once full charge), Super easy connect with devices, the handle is very useful, music output is next level. The The purpose of the app is very minimal, probably while updating only.Update 2 : Some misunderstanding happened between my Mr Bose SLR2+ & my two üçé‚Äôs namely Mr Apple iPhone & Mr Apple iPad. Removed Mr iPad from linkage. Now things seem simple & fine. Enjoying music throughly.Update 3: A months use. Works seamlessly when summoned. Thumbs up.Update 4: Be sure not to place it on a glass top, speaker tends to vibrate & shift places. May fall down.Update 5: A year of use & simply loving it. Blissful"
39,"I waited a whole year since 2020 for the Amazon day sale in October 2021 and boy it was worth the wait. I got this beauty at 14k after the discount, cashback and savings from the ICICI Amazon Pay card. Its worth 25k as well but its good to win some times. Go for it."
40,"After investing so many days for the search of a good Speaker, finally I choose Bose Soundlink revolve + series 2. As I am using it for the last 3 days few things I would like to share.1. Build- In this price range may be it's not that much attractive, but yes the build quality is really good and it's water/splash resistance coating also alows you to take it outside from your room.2. Sound- The best part is at the high volume also, the purity of sound remains same. Bass & Treble just exact where it should be.3. Price- For sound lovers, price is not the matter when Bose arrived. But ya they can reduce it's price by atleast 2-3k. But I am ok with this price. üëç"
41,"I got this from Amazon earlier than expected. Came in perfect condition.But as someone else had also mentioned in the reviews the MRP on the box says Rs 19,500/- whereas I paid Rs 24,500/- for it. I'm satisfied with the product and love the sound but what's with the difference in pricing? From my experience I usually pay lesser than the MRPs marked on the product box. Amazon please explain this!Aside from this the sound quality, bass and power of this speaker is terrific! Extremely happy with the sound.You can also control the sound and bass based on where you place it in a room. Corners tend to enhance the bass whereas the center of the room gives a more balanced sound."
42,
43,Sounds quality is awesome‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very loud and crystal clear sound‚Ä¶. Not much bass but its comfortable to hear any music movies videos‚Ä¶. Coming to the battery good back up and it‚Äôs long lasting and day charging comparing to other bose speakers..Battery is really good.. blindly go for it if u have budget in this range..Its mind blowing
44,"The quality of sound is amazing! Being a music buff myself, quality is extremely important to me and this product was suggested to me by an audio tech expert. I was a little skeptical because of the price but took the plunge anyway. I do not regret one bit because the sound is very well rounded, it's such a treat to watch action movies with this one :)"
45,"Got it for 15k on the Amazon Day sale, its totally worth 25k as well. The sound quality is better than others on the market. It is very portable and less than 1kg weight. 360 sound effect is amazing. It has one of the best surround bass I have experienced on a portable speaker. Its very hardcode on build quality. My friend dropped it from 2nd Floor and just a couple of scratches, works totally fine still."
46,"My first Bose buy , I remember visiting a Bose Store in CP some 3 decades ago and being mesmerised by Sound itself ! Best ever quality of sound  next only to a Live performance , ofcourse !So wonderful to be able to have this incredible piece of technology !!!Thank you to the Creator of Bose &  Team , Amazon Seller & Team who Delivered this to our doorstep üëçüèª"
47,U wont expect the features you r abt to experience !!!Brain bending sound!!!Any type of music is heavenüòçüòçüòç!Its good to see 30% off on 26&27july prime days... u can save upto 7.5k but you cant get refund after purchase so wait and buy and get it for 17k. You wont be disappointed evn if u buy for 24k like meüòÖ
48,Nice and good looking top notch speaker
49,"Been using them for almost 2 months now. The sound quality is excellent, very loud. Works very well for a party of 15-18 people. I love it‚Äôs design and that it can be connected to 5 devices at a time. No hassle or stops during a party."
50,Good sound quality nd blutooth contact
51,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†The sound quality is amazing. It's a good investment for music lovers.Helps you disconnect with the world and focus on music. The battery life is around amazing too and the voice quality of calls and video calls is fantastic.Have being using this for 20 days.  Though it is not expensive but when it's on on sale, it's a deal for sure."
52,Value for money purchase. Bought it at lowest price during the Amazon Prime Day sale. very satisfied with the sound as well as Battery performance which is long lasting upto 16+ hours.
53,"MRP on the box was 19,900 Rupees. But Amazon sells it for 24,500 Rupees. However the Sound quality and Voice are terrific !!! Awesome product !!"
54,"Sound wise, these are everything you'd expect a Bose speaker to be, but my main purpose for buying these was to cast audio from video calls to this device. However, they instantly disconnect when I try to answer video calls, which is very annoying. You can only answer audio calls.Really disappointed by this behaviour!"
55,"Good quality sound, suitable for in home listening."
56,"Price on box is 19900 and Amazon charged us 23000, quality wise gud"
57,"It isn‚Äôt the loudest portable speaker but the sound is good, clean, and crisp. A very good everyday speaker!"
58,"Too much bass, difficult to understand remote party. Very limited control/settings options in its App. App cannot run without gps on."
59,Got the product early than estimated delivery date. Original packing. All inclusion as promised. Easy connectivity to my phone and awesome sound quality Best Buy just go for it. Thank you Amazon
60,Price / Brand of the product doesn't match the sound expectation.
61,Just amazing...
62,Absolutely great.
63,Amazing sound quality
64,"Sound is too....good. fully satisfied with deep bass, treble and audio quality. So small speaker could produce good quality sound. I am going crazy for it."
65,A compact and fantastic piece! Crisp and clear sound. Good bass. Quick and easy BT connections. Long battery life. A total value for money deal!
66,"This speaker is not for those with sensitive ears or those who like to hear the singers voice more clearly than the instrument sounds. I got ear ache after using it for 30mins. There is no app not even Bose music app which supports this speaker thru which we can modify settings to reduce bass etc. only option is to use Spotify app always which has the playback settings but that is of not so much help. Since I cannot return it nor use it, it is in the store room after spending 25k. Amazon support nor Bose support could help."
67,Excellent balanced sound quality..but Mike not working properly
68,"Sound quality, value for money and bluetooth connectivity is too good"
69,Excellent product
70,Bose all products are amazingNice sound üëå
71,Speaker is normal. Not extra-ordinary as BOSE speaker is expected to be. Price is also very high.
72,Really love the sound quality of this!
73,Value for money
74,Great sound quality...its all that matters !
75,Very good Bose
76,This was original product and im happy with it
77,Amazing sound quality. Bose never disappoints.
78,Sound quality is best .
79,OMG!! what a product.
80,Its a great product
81,
82,Excellent product. I liked it a lot
83,"Speaker vol is not good . Won‚Äôt recommend to go for Bose , same vol quality with other cheaper product as well.  Don‚Äôt waste money"
84,Best sound quality
85,DOES THE JOB BUT DON'T EXPECT MUCH
86,Good.
87,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Best portable speaker... quick Bluetooth connection and great sound clarity..."
88,"The sound quality was a disappointment when i checked it in the showroom. The people here either had not experienced real sound or have other expectations than me. For me, it sounded really flat and dull in terms of bass. I already have Yamaha 109 sound bar and connected a Sony bass module. It‚Äôs a beast. Same or lesser price. Bose has become a tragedy. I expected so much. Not worth the investment."
89,
90,"Seems to be an used one or refurbished one. Apart from that, the box shows the MRP to the tune of 19K whereas 24K had been taken. It‚Äôs cheating."
91,Used product. Charging adapter and cable missing. Box heavily damaged when unboxing. Manufacture info tag replaced and stick with duck tape. Not sticker to peel off the top of speaker.
92,There is no battery availability at service centre itself already waited for more than 2 months.They are not able to get spares itself.TVS are the authorised service providers with pathetic service in india.Regreted buying bose..
93,"It's been over 3 months, my bose soundlink revolve+ bluetooth speaker is lying at bose service station (Klickit solutions and services Mumbai) for repair. So either bose products are irreparable (if so they should mention it while selling) or they don't have proper service support in India (if that's the case that should also be told while selling the product). Either way, I would never recommend ""bose"" products to anyone.#patheticservice #avoidbose. Your entire money will be zero once peoduct has any problem..."
94,"While the product itself is top notch as expected from Bose, the after sales service of Bose India support bosesupport@tvs-e.in is horrid to say the least. That‚Äôs why I give it one star for value for money.I‚Äôd not charged the product for a few days and the battery died down. Now it just won‚Äôt charge or switch on.Efforts made to resolve it from the website proved futile.Email written a month ago no reply. All details provided with a copy of the Amazon invoice and about the product no response.Now all  I have is a quarter of a lakh paper weight !!"
95,The media could not be loaded.
96,"No doubt sound quality is awesome but if you purchase such quality expensive product then customer will expect service as well.The day it may malfunction, believe me there is no support. Even software update destroys device motherboard costing half the price of product & even the hardware are not available at service centres.I'm seeking help to get my BOSE Revolve+ fixed but seems my 25000 is now a waste. I've tried service centre in Noida, Gurgaon, Chandigarh....they even do not have any technical knowledge."
97,"I got this product as if it came of a demo shelf. For a 30K product this is the first time I am experienceing this. I have bought Phone and gadgets worth 30K, never I got a product which was opened. Being a prime customer I don't think this was also checked properly before the delivery."
98,I got these for 14.5k each. Sound is Good for there size. Has good amount of bass. Don't except the low deep bass too much like from a seprate bass module but it's satisfying. Sound signature is balanced. Xtreme 2 and Sony xb43 will be more suited for a deeper bass but they are bulky.
99,"I will recommend you all not to purchase this product from AMAZON no matter what discount you‚Äôre being given. It costs around 19.5k in the market.However it‚Äôs very nice elegant looking speaker with premium sound quality. Also Bose app works above average.I know couple of people who got this same product from Amazon/Flipkart  and undoubtedly they were cheated.Be very cautious while you spend your hard earned money.To me personally, if I‚Äôm willing to purchase anything around this range I can settle for paying 1000 bucks more but won‚Äôt take refurbished stuff.This speaker is arguably BEST in business."
100,"A superb product.Problem is ,if something were to go wrong with your product like mine did ....to get it fixed is a nightmare and since the cost spent on the product was high enough the pinch too is likewise....terrible after sales and repair services by Bose !!!!"
101,Sound is mind blowing... But Bose should release cover for speaker's handle... Neither this will be dirty with time.....Bose has a reputation
102,It is a horrendous faux m glad I didn't buy it..is not worth 5000 Dont waste your money on this one....it is all lie....beware
103,Everything good except the packaging which was tampered. But rest it's bose so it's heaven. Good purchase as a gift
104,It‚Äôs an amazing sound system. Quality of sound is too good.Clarity of voice and instruments are pure treat to ears.
105,Poor quality sound and unable to connect phone calls in the speaker device. Not expected this kind of quality from BOSE üôÉ
106,"Software update in btu.bose but it's not https while update. I purchased product  sound link resolve + on 2017 but update software 3.1.1 but not change from red blinking on device and issues occurred on October 2021 (Warranty is 1 year ).So , I informed to customer care but not guide any technical call , but no technical support in the call and during the call required serial no and model but issue not resolved but they said need to go to service center but it's very away from place but not sure technical fees ."
107,"I have had this speaker for four years and it is still working great. I have had no issues and it still sounds very clear and consistent. When I spent 25,000 in 2017, i never thought I would get my money's worth to this extent. I have the Bose Portable Home Speaker but I still prefer this speaker as the sound is more natural and the mono effect really does it for me. I still get at least 8 - 10 hours on moderate volume. It looks great and is durable. Also BOSE Service is not great but once it stopped working and they gave me a new one. It stopped working because I put it in water so don't try that. The best feature is that I can connect to this without needing to switch it on. Simply go to bluetooth on your android or ios and connect to this speaker and boom, it connects, switches on.The sound? Great.I have owned the Bose Home speaker 500, I have the Bose Solo 5 soundbar, Bose Portable Home speaker, Apple Homepod Mini, used Marshall ..if you dont mind having a big speaker, try the Marshall Kilburn. That's got a much louder and room filling sound. But its bigger also.If you just want a speaker thats super loud, the bose portable home speaker is great.but if you care about mids (as you should) , try the Revolve Plus.Even today its a great deal.Bose need to release Bose Revolve Plus 2 and I'll buy it in a heart beat.PS - this review is for the first generation, i had no idea i was reviewing the second gen."
108,"First of all, two misleading pieces of information in the Amazon listing:1. The title says: ‚ÄòBose SoundLink Revolve+ II Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker with Alexa (Silver)‚Äô. However, there is NO Alexa.This is a serious piece of misleading information.2. In the country of origin, it is mentioned ‚ÄòMalaysia‚Äô. However, on the speaker box, it says ‚ÄòMade in Mexico‚Äô.Now, to the quality of the speaker. Well, the sound quality is just great. All the frequencies come out clearly and beautifully.Bluetooth connection is quick and hassle free. When listening to phone calls, the sound is crisp and clear.The Bose app is simple to use and works well with the speaker."
109,"Sound quality is good, it is clear but lacks bass. If you're looking for a speaker for a house party or outdoor use don't buy this as this is meant for casual listening.I feel it's not worth the amount you pay for it, would rather go for Marshall Emberton or JBL speakers."
110,"As expected Bose delivers excellent sound quality. Bass, voice and instruments are very clear. Ease of use through Bose connect app."
111,Amazing sound quality‚Ä¶never expected to get this in 15.5K during sale.
112,If you looking for portable speaker and you have budget then go for it without thinking twice.
113,Amazing clarity of sound.
114,Good
115,"This is my second Bose revolve after owning first gen revolve. This has always been my go to speaker. The sound is excellent, and a few of my friends have commented on this. Battery life is excellent too. The black finish  looks great too. Love it !"
116,"great sound , portable , good battery life , very happy with product"
117,"Item provides a great sound, wish the buttons to work it could be seen better"
