       "['Amazon Basics Earbuds arrived in an excellent and typical Amazon Basics Box and it contained the Matte Charging Case along with the EarBuds which is partly Matte and partly Glossy along with a USB Type C cable and few spare ear tips The build quality is amazing as usual and feels sturdy even though I m not a huge fan of matte designed products The most important thing to note is this Earbuds are so big and bulky which might not fit into someone who are having small or medium ears I suppose Although it was light weight I felt little uncomfortable while the pTron Earbuds were of a perfect fit to my ears which was neither bulky nor long and bigger when compared this one But having changed the ear tips to smaller one provided it felt better but it was still uncomfortable due to its bulky size Features There is a lot of touch controls available to for increasing and decreasing the volume playing the next track pause and play etc But it doesn t work flawlessly It was always a hit and miss kind in my Samsung Smartphone which was little annoying at the beginning But as I was using it more often it felt ok eventhough there was a little delay in response which we will get used to while using it on a daily basis I liked the sound effect they used to indicate the Earbuds establishing the Bluetooth connectivity and also when it gets disconnected It was so pleasant for me I never liked the usual connected and disconnected voice messages This is one feature I really like in this Amazon Basics Earbuds Performance The most disappointing thing about this Earbuds is it s performance First I tried using it to listen to the Podcast which gave me a pleasant experience in terms of sound quality and I was happy But each time I try to pause a podcast episode by using long press it played the next episode instead of pausing So it was a turn off for listening to Podcasts But the touch controls were working perfectly when I connected it to my secondary Tecno Spark phone and pause and play was working perfectly Wonder why it wasnt the same when conected to my Samsung Smartphone Now I tried to use this Earbuds for listening to songs There was a wierd buzzing noise constantly occuring which is total turn off while listening to music But when I tried using it for longer this particular buzzing noise was noticed only in a very few songs in my playlist while other songs played as usual Unfortunately both my favourite songs that I played at first had that buzzing noise while using this earbuds Though the same songs play perfectly in other bluetooth earbuds But in general sound quality is good and clear And finally the only one good aspect about this Earbuds is the actual ease of using it was while on a call The sound quality was clear and the receiver was able to hear me properly so there is no problem with the mic too And as same as the pTron Earbuds in my earlier review in Amazon this one also looses connectivity just moving a couple of steps away from the phone which is another disappointment So far Boat Bluetooth Headset has been the best when comes to staying connected for a fair distance But considering most Bluetooth earbuds facing the same issue except a very few its manageable for most people Battery performance is good but cant say about the charging time as the device is yet to run out of charge First impression of battery is good It came with almost full charge out of the box and after a custom full charge before using I have not yet required to charge the device For every and a half hours of playback the battery gets reduced by which is quite good and promising Pros Good voice clarity and mic performance during a call Connectivity Sounds Competitive Pricing Build Quality Volume Increase and Decrease Touch Controls Cons Buzzing Noise while listening to music but only in few songs for reasons unknown Frequent disconnections due to poor Bluetooth range Bulky and Big Conclusion This Earbuds looks so promising with good build quality at a competitive price of Rs but there are a few performance issues which is not expected from an Amazon Basics Product I m not sure if I had received a defective product but after the initial impression this pair of earbuds performed much better overall when used frequently Thought of getting a replacement but it seems like a common defect for all so even if I go for replacement it will be having the same issue I guess So decided to use this as a backup for calls and some music as and when needed as a backup having got at Rs with so many offers and cashback bringing the price further down to reasonably a very affordable one Overall a very valuable purchase I must say Anyways at this price point its a good deal inspite of some imperfections when comes to performance Note Rated Stars from earlier Stars and updated the review after using it for an extended time period for the Build Quality and some innovations tried by Amazon Basics at a good affordable price Performance and touch controls seemed to work much better after using it frequently ',\n",
       " 'Zero Bass If u r a bass lover then just skip this no need to buy Only calm music can be heard on it clearly Vocals in background r not clear and the crackling sound is too much annoying Even if there is a very low bass in the music then this earbuds start crackling I m so annoyed that i felt if my eardrum has burst due to crackles Built quality is good look is good sound is high No bass crackles for small bass also bluetooth connect is very slow No response if box is opened Late finding of devices I have already returned this product instead gone for truke brand ',\n",
